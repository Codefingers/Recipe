# Recipe
This is a backend service responsible for handling request around Recipes and its related entities such as 
ingredients, and steps. 

#WIP
## Getting started
To get started with development there are two options:

### Option 1 - Docker
If you are running with Docker, setup is easy as 
`docker-compose up --build` 

## Direction
Future plans include:
 - Splitting user management into a separate service to avoid a monolithic service.
